## Why

I was a bit frustrated: why does nothing happen if I press [Record] in Streamripper 2?!
So it was my challenge: show something what happens or show an error that I am able to read and to analyze.

If this was done I saw why a few streams do not start to donload.
Do I need to fetch a real stream first by following "location:" or grep the 1st line of a m3u playlist.

With the different station plugins exist several constellations. This script is an initial point and not feature complete yet.
