## Why

I was a bit frustrated: why does nothing happen if I press [Record] in Streamripper 2?!
So it was my challenge: show something what happens or show an error that I am able to read and to analyze.

If this was done I saw why a few streams do not start to donload.
Do I need to fetch a real stream first by following "location:" or grep the 1st line of a m3u playlist.

With the different station plugins exist several constellations. This script is an initial point and not feature complete yet.

## Features

* You get output! Which stream was requested, http headers for details. 
* on error: a window does not just close - you have 60 sec to read it
* automatic fetching for a real streaming url in some playlist types
* support for the download of files (Jamendo, MODarchive) with automatic renaming
* remove unused streamripper output directories and cleanup of 'incomlete' dirs
* command line parameter support

### Stop on error

If any error occours before the download starts you get a few debug infos about the http header.
On exist the script waits that you are able to read the output.

### Donwload files

Next to streamripper I detect single foles for mp3 or tracker files (.mod, .it, .st3).
If a file was found it will be downloaded.
